			<h2>Jerwood Laboratory</h2>
			<h3>HTML, CSS, PHP, Zend Framework</h3>
			<p>Supporting an experimental month-long exhibition at the Jerwood Space, this site gathered information from various sources - Flickr, Twitter and the Jerwood blog.  Built in conjunction with <a href="http://www.thepartners.co.uk/" rel="external">The Partners</a> and <a href="http://www.petegoodman.com/" rel="external">Pete Goodman</a>, each days posts were printed out to be added to the physical exhibition catalogue.

The script allows you to overlay an image onto a page, <br />very useful for checking a build against the original designs.</p>
